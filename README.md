# Food Inventory

Recently I found an old jar of pesto in the back of my family's fridge and decided that I needed to do something to reduce their food waste. To solve this problem, I built this website so that they could easily keep track of both their opened and unopened food.

Since they would all be busy, I designed the website to be as convenient to use as possible by adding speech recognition functionality. This means that while someone is putting food away after shopping, they can simply say what items they want to add to the list.
